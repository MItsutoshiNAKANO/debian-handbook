			One of the best-known features of Debian is its ability to upgrade an installed system from one stable release to the next: <span
            class="foreignphrase"><em
              class="foreignphrase">dist-upgrade</em></span> — a well-known phrase — has largely contributed to the project's reputation. With a few precautions, upgrading a computer can take as little as a few minutes, or a few dozen minutes, depending on the download speed from the package repositories.

            class="para">
				Since Debian has quite some time to evolve in-between stable releases, you should read the release notes before upgrading.
			</div><div
            class="sidebar"><div
              class="titlepage"><div><div><p

              class="para">
				The release notes for an operating system (and, more generally, for any software) are a document giving an overview of the software, with some details concerning the particularities of one version. These documents are generally short compared to the complete documentation, and they usually list the features which have been introduced since the previous version. They also give details on upgrading procedures, warnings for users of previous versions, and sometimes errata.
			</div><div
              class="para">
				Release notes are available online: the release notes for the current stable release have a dedicated URL, while older release notes can be found with their codenames: <div
                class="url">→ <a
                  href="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/releasenotes">http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/releasenotes</a></div> <div

            class="para">
				In this section, we will focus on upgrading a <span
              class="distribution distribution">Wheezy</span> system to <span
              class="distribution distribution">Jessie</span>. This is a major operation on a system; as such, it is never 100% risk-free, and should not be attempted before all important data has been backed up.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				Another good habit which makes the upgrade easier (and shorter) is to tidy your installed packages and keep only the ones that are really needed. Helpful tools to do that include <code
              class="command">aptitude</code>, <code
              class="command">deborphan</code> and <code
              class="command">debfoster</code> (see <a
              class="xref"
              href="sect.apt-get.html#sect.automatic-tracking">
      قسمت 6.2.7, “Tracking Automatically Installed Packages”
    </a>). For example, you can use the following command, and then use <code
              class="command">aptitude</code>'s interactive mode to double check and fine-tune the scheduled removals:
			</div><pre
            class="screen"># <strong
              class="userinput"><code>deborphan | xargs aptitude --schedule-only remove</code></strong></pre><div
            class="para">
				Now for the upgrading itself. First, you need to change the <code
              class="filename">/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file to tell APT to get its packages from <span
              class="distribution distribution">Jessie</span> instead of <span
              class="distribution distribution">Wheezy</span>. If the file only contains references to <span
              class="distribution distribution">Stable</span> rather than explicit codenames, the change isn't even required, since <span
              class="distribution distribution">Stable</span> always refers to the latest released version of Debian. In both cases, the database of available packages must be refreshed (with the <code
              class="command">apt-get update</code> command or the refresh button in <code
              class="command">synaptic</code>).
			</div><div
            class="para">
				Once these new package sources are registered, you should first do a minimal upgrade with <code
              class="command">apt-get upgrade</code>. By doing the upgrade in two steps, we ease the job of the package management tools and often ensure that we have the latest versions of those, which might have accumulated bugfixes and improvements required to complete the full distribution upgrade.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				Once this first upgrade is done, it is time to handle the upgrade itself, either with <code
              class="command">apt-get dist-upgrade</code>, <code
              class="command">aptitude</code>, or <code
              class="command">synaptic</code>. You should carefully check the suggested actions before applying them: you might want to add suggested packages or deselect packages which are only recommended and known not to be useful. In any case, the front-end should come up with a scenario ending in a coherent and up-to-date <span
              class="distribution distribution">Jessie</span> system. Then, all you need is to do is wait while the required packages are downloaded, answer the Debconf questions and possibly those about locally modified configuration files, and sit back while APT does its magic.

            class="para">
				In spite of the Debian maintainers' best efforts, a major system upgrade isn't always as smooth as you could wish. New software versions may be incompatible with previous ones (for instance, their default behavior or their data format may have changed). Also, some bugs may slip through the cracks despite the testing phase which always precedes a Debian release.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				To anticipate some of these problems, you can install the <span
              class="pkg pkg">apt-listchanges</span> package, which displays information about possible problems at the beginning of a package upgrade. This information is compiled by the package maintainers and put in <code
              class="filename">/usr/share/doc/<em
                class="replaceable">package</em>/NEWS.Debian</code> files for the benefit of users. Reading these files (possibly through <span
              class="pkg pkg">apt-listchanges</span>) should help you avoid bad surprises.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				You might sometimes find that the new version of a software doesn't work at all. This generally happens if the application isn't particularly popular and hasn't been tested enough; a last-minute update can also introduce regressions which are only found after the stable release. In both cases, the first thing to do is to have a look at the bug tracking system at <code
              class="literal">http://bugs.debian.org/<em
                class="replaceable">package</em></code>, and check whether the problem has already been reported. If it hasn't, you should report it yourself with <code
              class="command">reportbug</code>. If it is already known, the bug report and the associated messages are usually an excellent source of information related to the bug:

					</div></li></ul></div><div
            class="para">
				Depending on the severity of the bug, a new version of the package may be prepared specifically for a new revision of the stable release. When this happens, the fixed package is made available in the <code

              href="apt.html#sect.proposed-updates">
      قسمت 6.1.2.3, “Proposed Updates”
    </a>). The corresponding entry can then be temporarily added to the <code

			</div><div
